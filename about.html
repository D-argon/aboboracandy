          there are a *ton* more, but these are the "personality defining" ones
        </p>
        <p class="content__paragraph">
          I enjoy <strong class="caps">rpg</strong> too! Delving in
          <strong class="caps">GUMSHOE</strong> and investigation in general,
          so Esoterrorists, Trail of Cthulhu, etc, but I do DnD too<br />
          My most obvious one is coding, especially front-end, but I aim to
          someday be a game-dev at least in one game!
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2 id="consume">The ones I consume:</h2>
        <h3>Movies</h3>
        <p class="content__paragraph">
          Im a big fan of horror and animation in general, so my top 3 is
          Coraline, Skinamarink and Across the Spiderverse. The amount of
          anxiety that i get watching these is insane.<br />
          <small class="small">(specially Skinamarink but that's reasonable)</small>
        </p>
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p class="content__paragraph">
          anything with <span class="alt">cool bass</span>, but rock, post
          punk, jazz and indie games OST's ( I like a LOT but the go for is
          <em>Life is Strange</em>!).<br />I really go for indie in
          everything, but mostly, and speaking of which...
        </p>
        <h3>Games</h3>
        <p class="content__paragraph">
          i could go for hours but, as I said, it's intend to be
          indicatives around this web. But worry not fellow internaut, for I shan't
          leave you with nothing.<br />
          Any games with rich universe or art design breaks all my
          cognitive functions and scratches the brain like no other escapism. So
          I'd say, for the moment, The Eternal, and previously mentioned,
          <span class="alt">Life is Strange</span> (specially the Captain
          Spirit standalone), <span class="alt">Blasphemous</span> and
          <span class="alt">Fran Bow</span>.
        </p>
        <h3>Reading</h3>
        <p class="content__paragraph">
          as for reading I don't have thaaat much enthusiasm, but anything that
          relates with the other topics (game dev, indie stuff, music, etc) is cool
          and hard to reads (in a technical sense).<br />
          My top three, hmmm...
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li lang="pt-BR" translate="no">Angústia</li>
          <li lang="it" translate="no"><del>Divina</del> Comeddia</li>
          <li lang="ja" translate="no">Oyasumi Punpun</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content__paragraph">
          Angústia bends the reading process with it's 'anguishing' structure and plot.
          For a 1930's book that's pretty rad, specially with the context Graciliano,
          the author, wrote it.<br />
          Commedia doesn't need much introduction, dood really got his name as an
          anachronic good quality adjective, "Dantesque".<br />
          Punpun is solely to be very contradictory &#62&#58&#41 <br /> jk<br />
          it was one of the first mangas I got to read and I really like the way
          Inio drives it's plot and characters, two childhood friends with a fucked
          up life that end up just being really bad for each other despite their
          efforts.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="content__paragraph">
          That's it! Krilly was working on the background but I need his help for other stuff, hopefully this won't get
          vandalized.
