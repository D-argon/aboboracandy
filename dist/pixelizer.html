              <p>
                damn this is harder than I planned, JS is a mess and this HTML
                will be pretty soon too if I postpone my mega thinking.<br />
                I do have the "better modals" checked tho
              </p>
              <p>
                welp, it's been 6 months...<br />
                I think.
              </p>
              <p>
                I really wanted to do the definitive blog element that is
                blogging but another HTML in the nav feels weird and I'm already
                thinking of getting rid of the 'about.html' to place it
                somewhere else + making another home and make the 'index.html'
                follow-up there.<br />
                Also Jesus Christ I was re-reading my intro and I felt
                illiterate. Writing like a 5yo smh
              </p>
              <p>
                anyway I'm going to italy in 4 days &#58;P<br />
                If any fans want to meet me B&#41;<br />
                u won't.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope to take a lot of pictures that I can share here after

                tbh I'm mega nervous<br />
                I'm going with less money than you should go bc I'm planning to
                buy a mega pc that would cost me 3k US dollars here, so I'm
                saving money &#40;around 1k&#41; and getting a better PC by
                intercontinental'ing, how cool is that?

              <p>Other than that</p>
              <p>
                <br />
                I didn't get in at the first call the uni does &#40;they make
                2/3 to make sure every slot is filled, and ppl usually
                give-up/go for better ones&#41;, the second one comes tomorrow.
                <br />
                I don't think I'll get in w the major I wanted, CS, but I'm
                already in at another similar major, Informations on Systems or

              <h2>testing 1 2 3</h2>
              <h3>31 / Mar / 2024</h3>
              <p>
                I'm back from my trip! Although it was my plan/ what I wanted
                that's not what I'm writing about today. <br />
                There has been one major character development event in my life
                this week, 'fuckin ur head pretty badly' type of, so I'm
                currently unable to do what I was planning to bring, unable to
                do anything at all lmao.
              </p>
              <p>
                and it is kinda funny. I think, from what I've seen, that my way
                of coping is off the curve. I'm able to see it from different
                perspectives, so observing my condition and thinking ab it helps
                me in a way, as I can detach from my current reality, and my
                love/interest for the human behavior and mind actually helps a
                lot.
              </p>
              <p>
                most of times I would have issues with anxiety but nothing
                unbearable, I could just relax by playing games or making myself
                busy and it would "go away". The way I see it, my problems
                disturb me during a certain time limit. When I can speed up or
                skip it, I'm able to solve it wayyy smoother, if they don't just
                disappear.
              </p>
              <p>
                in the end, I think that if the issue is not something u can
                control/confront/handle/solve, there's nothing else to do than
                to escape reality. I'm not the best w analogies, but say it's
                grief from a loved one, it's an emotion, involuntary,
                incontrollable. U need to feel it for the entirety of it to
                start healing, and some ppl ignore it, just postponing the
                problem. Yes ppl handle differently, but that's my point,
                escaping reality can help u and without it ppl would go mad, the
                word has been kinda distorted like 'manipulation' or 'drug', but
                when u go through a exhaustive day and need to rewind, u escape
                reality, be it hanging w friends, playing, in worst cases
                drinking, etc. U don't forget, but put aside the problems and
                kinda restart ur mind. So u gotta learn how to do escapism, and
                in a healthy way.
              </p>
              <p>
                I consider myself a master of the escapism art, not that I do it
                all the time, I actually enjoy being in challenging situations,
                but the mind can only take so much, and for some reason, or
                combination of situations, that I have conscience what they are,
                this time was wayyy off. I don't really know what a panic attack
                is and from what I read I don't think it's the case. From my
                experience, there's anxiety, u get it through the day like
                everybody does, something worries u but 10min it's over. There's
                anxiety where u feel ur heart beating, u're confessing ur love
                or regret something deeply, it doesn't go away until u talk it
                out. And there's this one where I'm at, heart beats so hard it
                hurts and u feel ur whole body, it's somewhat annoying as I get
                bad headaches or can't sleep bc of it. Talking it out to the
                person I needed reduced the frequency, but the problem still is
                what I wake up and go to sleep thinking of. Maybe I was wrong ab
                all the times I thought I was going through grief and this is
                the real deal and I'm saying loads of nonsense now, but where's
                the fun and instigation in that assumption?

                Disclaimer: I'm talking my mind, don't take this as a
                professional advice. from all the methods of escape I know,
                don't think I'm able to talk ab some of them here nor would I,
                as some can be very personal to the individual or
                disturbing/harmful, but there's one that is perfect in all the
                aspects I consider for good ones. Is it healthy? Is it easy?
                Does it disturb something crucial?<br />
                Music, for me, fairly easy, healthy if not too loud + too long,
                but it fails in disturbing the necessity of crying sometimes, as
                u can kinda close ur eyes to the problem. <br />Drinking,
                addictive, costs money, does not make any progress to the
                problem at all, it's a last resort, big no no. <br />And then
                there's Sleeping, this is just the apex predator to unsolvable
                problems, essential for life, do it anywhere, and u work w ur
                subconscient to solve the issue. Of course u can't sleep ur
                whole life away, but the free time u would be anguishing is now
                filled w a time skipper/problem solver.<br />
                Writing often helps too, poems or just a conversations w myself.

                but that's it, I'll be placing my trip photos up soon and
                talking ab them, gotta edit them first and finish the .html.
                I'll figure a way to organize these journal and create a folder
                system.
