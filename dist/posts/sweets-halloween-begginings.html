          <p>YE BRO</p>
          <p>I COOKS™</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            they were indeed very yummey, and I had great help with
            <span class="alt">the dumps</span> (actually made last xmas :P)<br />
            oh my, I hadn't had these in
            <span class="alt">sooo long</span>...<br />
            it had a good amount of sugar and love and happiness and
            deliciousness an... oh I wish I could eat it again T^T<br />
            welp, now I can stand by the name proudly. it's actually funny how
            much I enjoy cooking and everything about it -- the process, the
            un-fixed'ness, the reward of it all. just the right amount of
            <span class="alt">nothing and everything by itself</span>. my
            peaceful chaos. and I actually learned that it can be nice to do it
            with someone else !
          </p>
          <p>
            anyways!<br />
            what. a. year.<br />
            has all my absence been 2 desserts? well....... kinda...<br />
            a <span class="alt">lot</span> has changed, I changed a
            <span class="alt">lot</span>, and changing
            <span class="alt">is</span> still happening right as I type these
            silly words. many ppl graced me with their presence and many
            diverged from my path, but
            <span class="alt"
              >it is always nice to make, and care for, friends</span
            >, regardless of how much contact I maintain with them. this feels
            so distant from my past-self -- I don't think they would ever have
            had this much energy lol. tho maybe it was just stored somewhere. to
            top this off, it feels nice to pick it up from where I left! like
            caring for something stored in the attic (if I ever had one). tho
            now I believe I'm more code-organized B)
          </p>
          <p>
            speaking of the "forgotten in the attic", i.e.
            <span class="alt">The aboboraPurge.exe</span>, no I didn't plan to
            ever touch this again. simply bc I wasn't relating to anything I was
            doing at the time. but guess what? now I feel like it :3. I have a
            lot of brain juice to input here and rework previous ideas, so I
            will be pestering this address a little longer ! I think it will
            continue to serve as an open diary that only I will fully
            comprehend<br />
            btw I do plan on making a more inviting reading journal, this is
            cool and all but doesn't seem long-term friendly
          </p>
          <p>
            what can we bring here? hmmm <br />
            there's this very nice
            <span class="alt">mystery visual-novel doomed-yuri</span> that just
            came out (for <span class="alt">FREE</span>)

            and I cannot stress enough how much u should try it out if u can.
            lots of brain foods and eye candies constantly hitting u by
            surprise. also the OST is radiant. this very screenshot talkin about
            the 'need' to be observed is deeply relating to various ideas of
            mine -- like, I even said that this website is an "open diary", so I
            can't deny the fact this is a way of getting attention, even if not
            explicitly -- and it's great to read/hear it somewhere else.
          </p>
          <p>
            other than that, I had a spectacular
            <span class="alt">Halloween</span><br />
            we did quite simple decorations, but they ended up looking so
            neat.<br />
            it's very comfy to spend some time w new frens and I got a couple of
            fun pics<br />
            here's some of them:
