					it's around 4am as I write bc there's a must to fix my sleep schedule 
					and nothing better than stop procrastinating my blog.
					</p>
					<p>I regret to inform that I was almost uploading a pseudo-report at
					international red velvet's day, i.e. december 23, for "react2Shell", or 
					CVE-2025-55182, deployment saying what I could understand of it, 
					crazy EPSS scores and how it was managing my first PoC, tho quite simple,
					with some other side talks, when I vibe-configured my Arch too hard and
					"had" to fresh install it -- do not ask AI to optmize ur hibernation at 
					late hours (or ever tbh). so it's lost, but for a better purpose as I 
					fixed some mistakes and learned more on the new installation (also 
					finishing my milk inspired desktop).
					</p>
					<p>
					with another year shining upon our husks, I quote a nice phrasing from 
					<a class="link" 
					   href="https://sizeof.cat/post/2025-in-review/" 
					   target="_blank"
					   >cat's end of year blogging</a>...
				   <blockquote cite="https://sizeof.cat/post/2025-in-review/">
					   <p>Friend, it’s real, even if it ends. [...] </p>
					   <p>Most people feed so much on the end result, the messy 
					   break-up, the hate [...] But important are the times before 
					   that, [...]</p>
				   </blockquote>
				   as I relate greatly with it and somewhat resonates with my new year's
				   resolution.
					</p>
					<p>
					that said I have lots to do. personal stuff, setting up a
					good layout here for easier [b]logging, or academically related. my 
					year started very nice and this busy-ness mean to me that it's
					going to be even nicer. I've got some [other] side projects too, like a
					bigass 19" CRT I recently got that is not displaying the Red channel and
					I pretend to document (maybe on github?) how I fix it, that is, if I do.
					There's also my eternal journey on Arch I've just started, paired with
					another machine with NixOS :D and being able to properly manage my 
					money...<br>
					who would have guessed that getting to-be junk eletronics, music
					concerts and buying Vermis from the other side of the globe could be 
					quite heavy on the pay. (pretend I'm not fuzzying around for a 
					Walkman that's surely to be malfunctioning too).

					-- first of all, rip sizeofcat. They have been a nice inspiration the past
					couple of months and it was quite fun to hang at the cafe. apparently
					they had an issue with privacy and decided to erase their presence, from 
					what I understood of the chan's thread "what happened to that f*g**t?" 
					or wtv it was titled lol. --
					</p>
					<p>
					oh wow I wrote quite a lot ! this is from the past month and I prob
					should've pushed earlier, there's some stuff to add here but I believe
					that separating in other logs helps the organization.<br>
					here's a screenshot of my ricing™ WIP I forgot to add (no I'm not double
					booting it's just backup of what was left).
					</p>
					<div class="imgWrapper">
						<a 
						 href="/imgs/media/journal/260802/archbtw.jpg"

								  /></a></div>
					<p>
					I finally have an actual setup and it's quite fun to sit on my silly
					chair to play lego batman and such.<br>
					Arch is way easier than I thought too, i don't understand why do ppl
					flex using it nor why there's this misconception of it being hard to use.
					I would feel more embarrased than proud to say that I spend the last months
					wasting time on computer designing and even then it still doesn't really
					work as intended.
					</p>
					<p>
					on the topic of configurations that don't work, the reason it took me
					so long to actually post is bc learning vim/nvim for someone that was
					used to vscode is quite the hassle. bad habits die hard indeed, tho I will
					advocate that vscode is very good for webdev, but that's just ab it lol.
					currently I've setup Lazy's pack manager and treesitter stuff. the flow is
					Vsplit html/css, and separate pages within tabs. not very practical as
					I need to do it everytime I want to edit stuff but work gotta be done.
					my plan is to figure out how to compile my .sass/.scss and improve the
					workflow in the meantime while actually learning good practices so I
					don't bloat nvim and accidently make vscode 2.0.
					</p>
					<p>very likely to have more posts today and maybe a new css for this
					goofy ahh background</p>
