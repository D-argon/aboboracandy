            okaaay, i don't remember how we did this... uhhhh long time no see?

          <p>
            today's topic is not about
            <span class="alt">The Great Abobora-purge</span> ! I doubt I'll
            actually delve personally deep in the topic but i do intend to bring
            it up in the future just so any previous enjoyer finds their way
            back here :&#41;<br />
            plus there's lots of stuff I need to update here, one step at a
            time.
          </p>
          <p>so, what is it today?</p>
          <p><strong>Movie of The Month</strong> !</p>
          <p>"omg what's that? what movie? when? why? how?"</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              a group from a <span class="alt">cat cafe</span> decides a movie
              and we review it!
            </li>
            <li>I havent had the chance to say yet!</li>
            <li>now? monthly? i believe i had till 31st to review</li>
            <li>Fun!</li>
            <li>
              actually good question! I'm unsure of what procedure to follow.
              I'll try to maintain somewhat of a casual + pseudo-cinephile
              approach, as I myself don't know a lot of stuff.

            I'm somewhat lost for where to begin on this one...<br />
            the movie was pleasantly simple. a fun idea with intriguing
            execution. The big empty
            <span class="alt">City</span>, as if an entity, and it's atmosphere,
            cyberia like cyber-haven, bedrooms as personality mirrors hinting
            interpretations; the old movie grains and the crazy fx builds up for
            a nonexistent familiarity.
            <span class="alt">nostalgia for something I never experienced</span
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think u really have to be up for the scene it's trying to place,
            like condemning an 8yo master hacker and others exaggerations,
            otherwise the movie lose its "magic" like any targeting general
            juvenile public. it really tries to sell, or romanticize, "hacking"
            with the usual stereotypes while protagonizing kids.
          </p>
          <p>
            for the characters, I really loved the way
            <span class="alt">Zero's</span> thoughts were interpreted as movie
            scenes and I wish they had explored it more than twice, bc of the
            great subtlety on his detachment from society and socially
            awkwardness. <br />
            <span class="alt">Kate</span> seems a little dull. I like all the
            tomboy'ish but she really seems a pixie. what about her mom? why is
            she with someone that all we get is that he's a badboy? why does she
            likes computers? it's all too superficial. Love how gorgeous she was
            with the fits and haircut tho. looking at the secondary characters,
            <span class="alt">Ramon</span> is cool'ish, idk if he's there for an
            agenda but it looks like a good play overall;
            <span class="alt">Nikon</span> is funny too, wish they had shown
            more of his friendship relations and their developments;
            <span class="alt">Joey</span> is there for the plot i guess and
            <span class="alt">Cereal Killer</span>, my actual favorite from the
            movie, cause Matthew Lilard and great identity for the next topic i
            want to bring... <br />
            <span class="alt">Plague</span> gets the same story laziness as we
            endure, "we need this to happen in the plot let's make a generic
            childish antagonist". althought I like his part on the subtle ideas
            that relationships are indeed a weakness here, but if you're only
            there for urself

            while Cereal really steals all the attention with it all, most of
            the movie's wardrobe is surprisingly good and fitting for the
            <span class="alt">alt'y and underground</span> idea it wants to
            pitch along with all that teen need for
            <span class="alt"
              >self-expression and belonging to something unique</span
            >. like the rollercoasters, I think it would be more representative
            if each one had a different way to dislocate but it is the NY
            hackers preferred way I guess.

            other than that, <br />
            I was really immersed with the <span class="alt">crazy fx</span> for
            visualizing the hacking moments. generic black and green screens and
            a "I'm in" wouldn't have sticked here. the only one that didn't
            quite relate to me was garbage's, but it all achieve a good way to
            catch the attention and maintain some level of logic.

            it was fun for me, the movie and this new activity ! while not
            perfect, it is quite enjoyable. I won't upload every weekend anymore
            cause there's lots for me to do, but at least once month i'll try.
            See yah next [mootm].
