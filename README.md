<p>
     I had this idea from my <abbr title="Computer Science">CS</abbr> course at <a href='https://www.alura.com.br/' target='_blank'>Alura</a>,
   the objective was to share a website that pixelated images my friends gave me but I rediscovered an old obssession that is a website hosted in 
   neocities, <a href='https://freckleskies.neocities.org' target='_blank'>freckleskies</a>, I ended emailing the creator and discovered many things, 
   so this is my first step on webdev'ing :P
</p>
<p>
     It works by creating a canvas, stablishing images as buttons, and by clicking
   the buttons, it process the pixels of chosen image (by reading the img data) then pushes
   their values in a array of arrays, or a matrix, then pixelizes the canvas, following that
   process.<br><br>
     For some reason this first version is buggy in the website host, so it's in the 'to do' list.
