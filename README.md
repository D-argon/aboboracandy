  I had this idea from my <abbr title="Computer Science">CS</abbr> course at <a href='https://www.alura.com.br/' target='_blank'>Alura</a>, the objective was to share a website that pixelated images my friends gave me but I rediscovered an old obssession that is a website hosted in neocities, <a href='https://freckleskies.neocities.org' target='_blank'>freckleskies</a>, I ended emailing the creator and discovered many things, so this is my first step on webdev'ing :P.
