<p>
     I had this idea from my <abbr title="Computer Science">CS</abbr> course at <a href='https://www.alura.com.br/' target='_blank'>alura</a>,
   the objective was to share a website that pixelated images my friends gave me, but I rediscovered an old website I was into, <a href='https://freckleskies.neocities.org' target='_blank'>freckleskies</a>. I ended emailing the creator and discovered many things, 
   so this is my first step on webdev'ing :P

     Feel free to explore!<br><br>
